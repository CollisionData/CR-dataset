# CR-dataset
CR-dataset is a large-scale collision risk dataset of *Collision Risk Estimation with Multi-span Temporal Information Combination*, which provides high-quality traffic accident videos recorded by dashboard cameras and collision risk annotation. 

All the data are collected from YOUTUBE and as a dataset which collects videos from the Internet, we take copyright of each video into consideration and plan to publish the dataset only with their URL and correspond annotation respectively.
