# CR-dataset
CR-dataset is a large-scale collision risk dataset of *Collision Risk Estimation with Multi-span Temporal Information Combination*, which provides high-quality traffic accident videos recorded by dashboard cameras and collision risk annotation. 

All the data are collected from YouTube and as a dataset which collects videos from the Internet, we take copyright of each video into consideration and plan to publish the dataset only with their URL and correspond annotation respectively.

<img src="https://github.com/CollisionData/CR-dataset/blob/master/images/attention.gif" width="270px" alt="图片说明" >
<img src="https://github.com/CollisionData/CR-dataset/blob/master/images/danger.gif" width="270px" alt="图片说明" >
</div>
<p align="center">Left: Level 1 (safe);  Middle: Level 2 (need to be careful);   Right: Level 3 (dangerous)</p>

### We are collating the CR-dataset right now and will upload it soon.
